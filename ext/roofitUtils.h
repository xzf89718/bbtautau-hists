   * PDFs, observables, and data, to compute the total error curve.
   *
   * Basically:
   * * for each parameter in the fit result, compute the error curve on each pdf
   * * add the curves linearly and store the result
   * * at the end, add the curves in quadrature
   *
   * This method works but it is slow. It has been found quicker to compute the error bin-by-bin
   * by calling @c getPropagatedError on @c RooAddition of the results of @c createIntegral on bins
   * that have to be merged together.
   *
   * It is this second method that is used in practice in @c doPlotFromWS.py
